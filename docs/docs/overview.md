# Overview 🎯

Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive
programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app
frameworks.

Languages are defined by their technical envelope—the choices made during development that shape the capabilities and
strengths of a language. Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is particularly suited to client development,
prioritizing both development (sub-second stateful hot reload) and high-quality production experiences across a wide
variety of compilation targets (web, mobile, and desktop).

Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter. Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps, but Dart
also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.

# Why Should You Learn Dart?

- Free and open source.
- To be comfortable in a flutter.
- To develop multi-platform apps for android, iOS, windows, mac, Linux, etc.
- Fastest growing programming language.
- Huge community support.
