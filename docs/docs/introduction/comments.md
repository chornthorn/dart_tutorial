Comments are the set of statements that are ignored by the dart compiler during program execution. They are only used to
explain the code to humans so the user can understand it better.

## Advantages Of Comments

* You can describe your code.
* Other people will understand your code more clearly.

## Types Of Comments

* Single-Line Comment: For commenting on a single line of code. E.g. // This is a single-line comment.
* Multi-Line Comment: For commenting on multiple lines of code. E.g. /* This is a multi-line comment. */
* Documentation Comment: For generating documentation or reference for a project/software package. E.g. /// This is a
  documentation comment
